### Validation Framework (2026-03-19) — COMPLETED

A complete pre-trade profitability validation framework implemented as pure functions (no broker required).

**Package:** `market_analyzer/validation/`
- `models.py` — `CheckResult`, `Severity` (PASS/WARN/FAIL), `Suite` (DAILY/ADVERSARIAL), `ValidationReport` (Pydantic with `summary`, `passed`, `failed`, `warned` computed fields)
- `profitability_audit.py` — 3 profitability audit checks
- `stress_scenarios.py` — 3 adversarial stress checks
- `daily_readiness.py` — orchestrators: `run_daily_checks()` (7 checks) and `run_adversarial_checks()` (3 checks)

**Daily Suite — `run_daily_checks()` — 7 checks:**

1. `commission_drag` — round-trip fees vs credit; PASS < 10% drag, WARN 10-25%, FAIL >= 25% (or zero credit)
2. `fill_quality` — bid-ask spread viability; PASS <= 1.5%, WARN 1.5-3%, FAIL > 3%
3. `margin_efficiency` — annualized ROC via `compute_income_yield()`; PASS >= 15%, WARN 10-15%, FAIL < 10%
4. `pop_gate` — probability of profit via `estimate_pop()`; PASS >= 65%, WARN >= 55%, FAIL < 55%
5. `ev_positive` — expected value in dollars per contract; PASS > 0, WARN > -10, FAIL <= -10
6. `entry_quality` — IV rank / DTE / RSI / regime via `check_income_entry()`; PASS if confirmed, WARN if score >= 0.45, FAIL otherwise
7. `exit_discipline` — trade spec has `profit_target_pct`, `stop_loss_pct`, `exit_dte` set; PASS if all present

**Adversarial Suite — `run_adversarial_checks()` — 3 checks:**

1. `gamma_stress` — max loss at 2σ move; R:R ratio vs wing width; PASS R:R <= 5:1, WARN 5-10:1, FAIL > 10:1
2. `vega_shock` — IV +30% spike impact; long-vega structures auto-PASS; FAIL if estimated loss >= 50% of credit
3. `breakeven_spread` — finds bid-ask spread % at which EV turns negative; FAIL if edge lost at <= 1%, WARN <= 2%, PASS > 2%

**CLI:** `do_validate` — runs both suites on a representative TradeSpec, displays PASS/WARN/FAIL per check

**Functional Tests:** `tests/functional/` — 8 modules, 45 tests
- `test_commission_drag.py`, `test_fill_quality.py`, `test_margin_efficiency.py`
- `test_profitability_gates.py` (POP gate + EV), `test_exit_discipline.py`
- `test_daily_workflow.py`, `test_adversarial_stress.py`, `test_drawdown_circuit.py`

### Entry-Level Intelligence (2026-03-20) — COMPLETED

Six new pure functions in `features/entry_levels.py` wired into IC strike selection and daily validation:

1. **`check_strike_proximity(trade_spec, levels)`** — gates entry when short strikes are within 0.5 ATR of key S/R levels; returns `StrikeProximityResult` with flags per leg
2. **`get_skew_optimal_strikes(ticker, vol_surface, regime_id)`** — uses skew slope to shift put/call strikes for better premium collection (R1/R2) or directional bias (R3)
3. **`compute_entry_level_score(trade_spec, technicals, levels, regime_id)`** — composite 0–1 score combining IV rank quality, DTE optimality, strike proximity, and regime alignment
4. **`compute_limit_order_price(trade_spec, quotes, slippage_pct)`** — returns a chase-limit price between mid and bid (credit) or mid and ask (debit) to avoid legging into bad fills
5. **`detect_pullback_alert(ticker, technicals, regime_id)`** — detects short-term pullback within a trend for better entry timing in R3; returns `PullbackAlert` with strength and suggested action
6. **`validate_entry_conditions(trade_spec, technicals, levels, vol_surface, regime_id)`** — orchestrates all entry checks into a single `EntryValidation` report (wired as validation check #10)

**CLI:** `do_entry_analysis TICKER` — displays full entry-level scoring with sub-component breakdown

---

### Trading Intelligence Reform (2026-03-20) — COMPLETED

10 features across exit intelligence, position sizing, DTE optimization, strategy switching, and IV rank quality.

#### Exit Intelligence (`features/exit_intelligence.py`)

- **`compute_regime_contingent_stops(trade_spec, regime_id, atr_pct)`** — tighter stops in R4, wider in R1; returns `RegimeStop` with `stop_trigger`, `urgency`, and rationale
- **`compute_trailing_profit_target(trade_spec, current_pnl_pct, regime_id)`** — ratchets profit target upward as trade profits; locks in gains at 40% then trails at 25% below high-water mark
- **`compute_theta_decay_curve(trade_spec, days_elapsed)`** — models expected P&L trajectory from entry to expiry using empirical theta decay curve; useful for "is this trade on track?" comparison

#### Position Sizing (`features/position_sizing.py` — expanded)

- **`compute_correlated_kelly(trade_spec, portfolio_positions, regime_id)`** — reduces Kelly fraction when new trade is correlated with existing positions (same sector or similar delta direction)
- **`compute_margin_regime_interaction(trade_spec, account_balance, regime_id)`** — scales position size down in R4 (max 0.5× normal) and up in R1 (max 1.2× normal) based on regime confidence
- **`compute_position_size(trade_spec, capital, risk_pct, regime_id, portfolio_positions)`** — unified entry point: calls Kelly → correlation adjustment → margin-regime interaction → returns `PositionSizeResult` with `contracts`, `capital_at_risk`, `rationale`

#### DTE Optimizer (`features/dte_optimizer.py`)

- **`compute_optimal_dte(ticker, vol_surface, regime_id, structure_type)`** — uses term structure slope and skew to find DTE with best theta/vega tradeoff; returns `DTERecommendation` with `optimal_dte`, `rationale`, and `term_structure_context`

**CLI:** `do_optimal_dte TICKER` — shows DTE recommendation with vol surface context

#### Strategy Switching

- **`recommend_strategy_switch(trade_spec, current_regime, new_regime)`** — detects regime change mid-trade and recommends structural conversion; `CONVERT_TO_DIAGONAL` (R1→R3), `CONVERT_TO_CALENDAR` (R2→R1), `CLOSE_FULL` (any→R4)

#### IV Rank Quality

- **`score_iv_rank_quality(ticker, iv_rank, ticker_type)`** — adjusts IV rank interpretation by ticker type (ETF vs equity vs index); ETFs have lower baseline, equities spike higher; returns `IVRankQuality` with adjusted score and `quality` label (premium/elevated/normal/low)
- **Validation check #10** — `iv_rank_quality` check added to daily suite: FAIL if IV rank quality is `low` for income trades

#### Adjustment Outcome Tracking

- **`record_adjustment_outcome(adjustment_type, pre_pnl, post_pnl, regime_id)`** — pure function that returns `AdjustmentOutcome` for eTrading to store and feed back into `calibrate_weights()`

---

### Bug Fixes (2026-03-20) — COMPLETED

Five fixes for correctness and robustness:

1. **max_loss POP computation** — `estimate_pop()` was using wing width before subtracting credit; now correctly uses `(wing_width - credit)` as max loss denominator
2. **Credit estimation** — `compute_income_yield()` was double-counting commissions when `entry_credit` already net of commissions; fixed parameter contract
3. **Stress graceful degradation** — `run_stress_suite()` no longer raises if a scenario has no positions; returns `ScenarioResult` with `skipped=True` instead
4. **Momentum override** — `assess_momentum()` was ignoring regime R4 hard stop and could return trade specs in high-vol trending regime; fixed
5. **Minimum credit filter** — `assess_iron_condor()` now rejects trade specs where total credit < $0.15 per share (un-executable on most brokers)

---

### Decision Audit Framework (2026-03-20) — COMPLETED

4-level audit framework for full decision traceability (`features/decision_audit.py`, `models/decision_audit.py`):

**`audit_decision(trade_spec, regime_result, validation_report, sizing_result, entry_validation)`** → `DecisionAudit`

| Level | What It Audits | Output |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| `leg_scores` | Each leg: strike vs spot distance, delta, premium quality | `LegAudit` per leg |
| `trade_scores` | Full structure: IV rank, DTE fit, regime alignment, exit params | `TradeAudit` |
| `portfolio_scores` | Concentration, correlation, buying power utilization | `PortfolioAudit` |
| `risk_scores` | Expected loss vs budget, gamma exposure, overnight risk flag | `RiskAudit` |

`DecisionAudit.summary` → one-line verdict: `"APPROVED: IC SPY R1 | score 0.82 | 4/4 levels pass"`
`DecisionAudit.blocking_issues` → list of strings for any level with score < 0.5

**CLI:** `do_audit TICKER` — runs full 4-level audit on representative trade, shows per-level scores and blocking issues

---

### Crash Sentinel (2026-03-20) — COMPLETED

Market crash early-warning system (`features/crash_sentinel.py`, `models/sentinel.py`):

**`assess_crash_sentinel(tickers, technicals_map, macro_context, vol_surface_map)`** → `SentinelReport`

Signal levels:

| Signal | Color | Meaning | Portfolio Action |
|--------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| `CLEAR` | GREEN | No crash indicators | Normal trading |
| `WATCH` | YELLOW | 1–2 soft indicators elevated | Monitor, tighten stops |
| `CAUTION` | ORANGE | 3+ indicators elevated or 1 critical | Reduce size, avoid new income |
| `ALERT` | RED | Critical cluster: VIX + credit spread + breadth | Close short premium, hedge |
| `PANIC` | BLUE | Extreme multi-factor spike (COVID/Black Monday type) | Close all short premium immediately |

Indicators assessed (9 total): VIX level + spike, credit spread widening, equity breadth collapse, put/call ratio, term structure inversion, cross-asset correlation spike, dollar spike, bond yield crash, momentum divergence.

`SentinelReport.dominant_signal` — the single signal driving the alert
`SentinelReport.indicator_detail` — dict of indicator name → value + threshold
`SentinelReport.recommended_actions` — list of concrete steps

**CLI:** `do_sentinel [TICKERS]` — displays signal color, dominant driver, and recommended actions

### Known eTrading Issues (from 2026-03-17 audit)

- Scan → propose → deploy flow: broken (wrong bandit priors, 0/50 proposals approved)
- Macro dashboard indicators: all null
- Risk dashboard expected loss: all null
- Mark-to-market: broken (zero broker quotes in embedded mode)
- CLI command routing: most commands fall back to `status`
- Regime/Ranking/Adjustment APIs: not exposed as REST endpoints

### eTrading Must Still Wire (E1-E27 from SYSTEMATIC_GAPS.md)

**Immediate (APIs ready in MA):**
- E1-E2: Pass `iv_rank` to all assessor calls and `iv_rank_map` to `rank()`
- E3: Pass `time_of_day` to `check_trade_health()`
- E4-E5: Pass `debug=True`, store `result.commentary` in `decision_lineage` JSON, surface `result.data_gaps` in UI
- E6: Call `validate_execution_quality()` before every order submission
- E9: Use `ma.registry` for lot sizes and strategy routing (especially India)

**Requires eTrading DB + scheduling (E14-E21):**
- TradeOutcome table + construction on close
- Bandit params update on every close
- Drift detection job (daily pre-market)
- Weight calibration (weekly)
- POP factor calibration (weekly)
- Threshold optimization (monthly)

## Known Limitations / Tech Debt

### Thin Implementations (functional but basic)

- **Setup signals** — `opportunity/setups/breakout.py`, `momentum.py`, `mean_reversion.py` use basic indicators; would benefit from multi-factor scoring (volume confirmation, sector relative strength, options flow)
- **Option play logic** — `opportunity/option_plays/leap.py` and `earnings.py` are thin; need deeper fundamental integration (earnings growth rate for LEAP scoring, vol crush magnitude history for earnings)
- **`check_vega_shock`** — uses `iv_spike_pct * 1.2` as a conservative approximation; actual vega impact should use broker Greeks when available

### ML / Learning (not started in production)

- **ML regime validation** — no system to track regime predictions against actual price behavior; HMM weights are not auto-retrained
- **POP calibration in production** — `calibrate_pop_factors(outcomes)` is implemented as a pure function but requires eTrading to supply trade outcome history; the live feedback loop is not running

### Documentation

- **USER_MANUAL.md** — 7 new CLI commands from 2026-03-20 not yet documented: `entry_analysis`, `kelly`, `optimal_dte`, `exit_intelligence`, `audit`, `sentinel`, and the expanded `validate`
- **SYSTEMATIC_GAPS.md** — test count header is stale; actual count is now 1715
- **MEMORY.md** — CLI command count is stale; actual count is now 67

### eTrading Integration Gaps

- Most MA APIs are fully implemented but not yet wired in eTrading (see E1-E27 in SYSTEMATIC_GAPS.md)
- Scan → propose → deploy flow is broken in eTrading (wrong bandit priors)
- REST endpoint exposure for Regime/Ranking/Adjustment APIs still needed
- Mark-to-market broken in eTrading embedded mode (zero broker quotes)

### Architecture Notes

- `challenge/` contains reference implementations only — eTrading must NOT import from it
- `rank()` output is NOT safe to execute directly — eTrading MUST call `filter_trades_with_portfolio()` and `evaluate_trade_gates()` before execution
- Dhan broker integration is a stub — `connect_dhan_from_session()` exists but full API not yet implemented
- `risk.py` function `estimate_portfolio_loss()` is ATR-based, NOT formal VaR; use `run_stress_suite()` for scenario analysis
